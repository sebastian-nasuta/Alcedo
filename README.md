# Alcedo

## Overview

Alcedo is a .NET MAUI application designed to generate descriptive tags for images and scan barcodes using Google Vision. The application allows users to load images, either from their device or by taking a photo, and then uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate relevant tags for the image. Additionally, it can scan barcodes and display the results.

The main features of Alcedo include:
- Loading images from the device or capturing photos using the camera.
- Compressing images to ensure they are within size limits.
- Generating descriptive tags for images using OpenAI's GPT model.
- Scanning barcodes using Google Vision and displaying the results.
- Copying generated tags and scanned barcodes to the clipboard for easy use.

Alcedo aims to simplify the process of generating and managing tags for images and scanning barcodes, making it easier for users to enhance their social media posts, organize their image collections, or manage barcode data.
